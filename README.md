# Housing-Price-Classification
Predictive modeling and data analysis project forecasting housing prices using classification and regression techniques.

## Overview
This self-initiated project aims to classify houses as **High-Price** or **Low-Price** using real estate data.  
It explores how various factors — such as area, number of rooms, and amenities — influence the market value of a property.

## Objective
To develop a **binary classification model** that categorizes houses based on their selling price using supervised learning techniques.

## Dataset
- Source: Housing dataset (CSV file)  
- Columns: Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Stories, Parking, Air Conditioning, Main Road, etc.  
- Target: Price Category (High or Low)

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Label encoding of categorical variables  
3. Feature scaling using StandardScaler  
4. Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest  
5. Evaluation using **Accuracy**, **Confusion Matrix**, and **Classification Report**  
6. Visualization of feature importance and model performance  

## Results
- Random Forest achieved higher classification accuracy.  
- Identified key features influencing price category (area, bedrooms, parking, air conditioning).  
- Clear distinction between high and low-priced houses.

## Visualizations
- Confusion Matrix for classification results  
- Feature Importance Bar Chart  

## Future Enhancements
- Add more regional and economic variables.  
- Extend classification to three categories (Low, Medium, High).  
- Explore ensemble and deep learning models.
